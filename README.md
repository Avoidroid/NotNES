# NotNES
An NES emulator for the Wii

# Loss of account
I am IMakeWii, but a few things have happened:

1. My hard drive kicked the bucket
2. I had lost my GitHub account to loss of 2FA recovery stuff
3. GitHub hadn't given me a chance to recover my account
4. GitHub Support just threw me a bot instead of a REAL PERSON
5. I had forgotten my password

So, conclusion: screw GitHub.
